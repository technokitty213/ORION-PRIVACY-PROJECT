physical and environmental alterations to an EXPERIMENTAL M1A1PHONE


no fellas I don't know how to read or write code

I do however enjoy playing around with assesibility options and settings

I don't believe in giving away my freedom of assuming my data and personal technology is secure.

Just call me a paranoid schizophrenic at heart.

good luck and thank you guys for always rendering me support when I need it.

I know nothing about software or the scary advances of certain technologies.

-but I tell ya what....im taking matters into my own little grubby hands from now on.

               peace and chicken grease
